  <h4 style="#ff66b3"> I always wanted to play a stringed instrument because I saw my uncle playing the guitar, and I thought the violin was like a mini guitar. I started playing in 4th grade and too private lessons. I never took violin too seriously until high school when I started to really get into music. My uncle would always offer to teach me how to play guitar but I would always say I prefer watching him play, and after he passed away, I started learning how to play. I stopped taking private violin lessons and started taking guitar lessons. In high school I stopped playing guitar as much as I used to and instead focused on violin, I also took up the keyboard when I did winter percussion. I only did winter percussion for one year because it was too much time, and I was not that great memorizing music especially on at keyboard. I currently continue to play violin, but prefer guitar now. I found music to be therapeutic and a a great pass time.</h4>
